## 📝Introduction 📝
The purpose of this project is to make a superficial sweep of the production and consumption of energy in Spain. It should be noted that the production analysis process does not include petroleum products that are used for conventional transportation, but it will be included in the consumption analysis.

In the following image you can see what the total energy consumption in Spain would be like including these.</p>

## 🏭Energy production in Spain in 2023🏭

Energy production in Spain is a very changing market, since events such as the Ukrainian War or subsidy policies or closures of thermal power plants have a short-term response.

Despite this, we can see in the following graphs the great diversity of sources and their importance.
Even as, finally, renewable energy sources are gaining ground over other energy sources.

<h2 style="color:#e39714"> 🌳Renewable energies 🌳 </h2> </center>
<h2 style="color:#e39714"> 🔥Non-renewable energies 🔥 </h2> </center>
In this section we will only analyze some data presented by some of the energies that are within this sector, such as nuclear energy and cogeneration energy.

<h3 style="color:#e39714"> ☢️Nuclear ☢️ </h3> </center>

In this graph we can clearly see the current situation of the nuclear plants in Spain and the journey they have taken since they were implemented in 1983.

A dramatic situation for one of the most efficient, safe and "ecological" energy sources ever.

<h3 style="color:#e39714"> ⚒️Cogeneration ⚒️ </h3> </center>
Cogeneration is one of the most unknown sources of energy and perhaps one of the most important since its purpose is to supply factories.
A challenge for the future is to find a way to adapt new energy sources to these circumstances and thus eliminate this energy or at least reduce it to a residual source.

<h2 style="color:#e39714"> 🌍Objectives of the National Energy and Climate Plan 2023-2030 🌍 </h2> </center>

At this point I would like to review how the Objectives of the National Energy and Climate Plan 2023-2030 are and the possibility of meeting them from an energy perspective.

The Ministry for the Energy Transition and the Demographic Challenge has published a proposal to review the National Integrated Energy and Climate Plan (PNIEC) to 2030. The final Plan must be submitted to the European Commission by June 2024 at the latest.

This plan includes numerous objectives but we are going to focus on two:
<ul>
   <li> Reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 32% in 2030 compared to 1990. Which meant going from 287,710 million tons to 201,397. The 2020 plan proposed a 23% reduction</li>
   <li> Reduce energy dependence to 51% in 2030 (in 2019 energy dependence was 73%)</li>
</ul>

The <em><strong>four main sources are</strong></em>: four main sources are the manufacturing industry, households, the energy sector, water and waste, and the transportation sector.

Traditionally, it has been seen that to achieve compensation for CO2 emissions in these sectors we will have to carry out transversal policies that more quickly favor the increase in the production of clean energy, the adaptation of the industry so that it can receive this type of energy (there are certain industries whose production sometimes cannot be produced without gas or derivatives).

The [complete transition](https://www.ree.es/es/datos/generacion/no-renovables-detalle-emisiones-CO2) would mean an approximate saving of more than 32 million tons of CO2. There remains more than 50 million tons to compensate in other sectors, although the increase in transport with electric vehicles could be crucial to achieving this transition.

The renewal of the vehicle fleet is an important tool to achieve the objectives of reducing emissions and improving air quality. Currently, a new vehicle has reduced NOx and 99% particle emissions compared to a vehicle that is more than 15 years old. Likewise, technological development and the incorporation of driving assistance systems is an important factor in increasing road safety with increasingly safer, more efficient and comfortable vehicles.

In the European Union, electric vehicles went from one in every 100 registrations in 2018 to almost one in seven in 2022
